We  develop  a  technique  to  evaluate  the  fault-tolerance  of  a  multi-agent  system  whose  number of  agents  is  unknown  at  design  time.  We  present a  method  for  injecting  a  variety  of  non-ideal  behaviours,  or  faults,  studied  in  the  safety-analysis literature into the abstract agent templates that are used  to  generate  an  unbounded  family  of  multi-agent  systems  with  different  sizes.  We  define  the parameterised  fault-tolerance  problem  as  the  decision  problem  of  establishing  whether  any  concrete  system,  in  which  the  ratio  of  faulty  versus non-faulty  agents  is  under  a  given  threshold,  satisfies a given temporal-epistemic specification. We put  forward  a  sound  and  complete  technique  for solving the problem for the semantical set-up considered. We present an implementation and a case study identifying the threshold under which the alpha swarm aggregation algorithm is robust to faults against its temporal-epistemic specifications
