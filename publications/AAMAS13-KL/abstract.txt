A key problem in verification of multi-agent systems by model checking concerns the fact that the state-space of the system grows exponentially with the number of agents present. This often makes practical model checking unfeasible whenever the system contains more than a few agents. In this paper we put forward a technique to establish a cutoff result, thereby showing that systems with an arbitrary number of agents can be verified by checking a single system consisting of a number of agents equal to the cutoff of the system. While this problem is undecidable in general, we here define a class of parameterised interpreted systems and a parameterised temporal-epistemic logic for which the result can be shown. We exemplify the theoretical results on a robotic example and present an implementation of the technique as an extension of MCMAS, an open-source model checker for multi-agent systems.
