We investigate the parameterised model checking problem for specifications expressed in alternating-time temporal logic. We introduce parameterised concurrent game structures representing infinitely many games with different number of agents. We introduce a parametric variant of ATL to express properties of the system irrespectively of the number of agents present in the system. While the parameterised model checking problem is undecidable, we define a special class of systems on which we develop a sound and complete counter abstraction technique. We illustrate the methodology here devised on the prioritised version of the train-gate-controller.
